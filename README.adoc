= Wicket Micro Benchmarks
Martijn Dashorst

This project provides a way to perform micro benchmarks for parts of Wicket.

It is based on and uses the JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harnass):

____
JMH is a Java harness for building, running, and analysing
nano/micro/milli/macro benchmarks written in Java and other languages
targetting the JVM.
____

To run a benchmark you need to build it first using Maven:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn package
----

This will create a `target/benchmarks.jar` uber-jar.

You can then run the micro benchmark from your IDE or from the commandline.

For example:

----
java -cp target/benchmarks.jar com.martijndashorst.wicketbenchmarks.LambdaModels
----
